						A very cool addition to minecraft are mods. Mods go from furniture to dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. If you host a minecraft server it is a very good idea to start a SMP(Survival Multiplayer).</p><img src="Pictures/steve.jpg"> </div>

It was released on Steam for Early Access in 2014, and it was releasedon Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in 2015. PLayes play as an inmate and must escape prisons of increasing difficulty. Players may acquire various tools to aid in their escape, by crafting them, bartering for them from other inmates, or by stealing them. Players can complete tasks for fellow inmates to improve their standing among them. Engaging in activities like exercise and study allows players to level up their characters, improving their abilities and their chance of escape. Players must avoid discovery by the prison guards, and so must follow the prison's daily routines, such eating prison meals. Players must be careful to hide their tools, as guards will periodically search the inmates' cells. If caught, the player is sent into solitary confinement, and their progress with the escape is reset.</p>
